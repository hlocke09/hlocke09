- 👋 Hi, I’m Hannah Locke, PhD
- 👀 I’m broadly interested in how variation in symbioses can drive differences in meaningful phenotypes. My PhD focused on plant-microbe interactions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning host-phage interactions, microfluidics, and improving my skills in R. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on working assessing plant-microbe interactions, microbial ecology, and bacteriophage interaction dynamics. 
- 📫 How to reach me: hlocke@udel.edu
